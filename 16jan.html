I made this just because today is a very good day for me, I don't know whether it is good for you or not. I had been thinking of doing this for many days, but sometimes I used to stop when I had some negative thoughts, today I gathered courage and did it. I didn't make this to make you sad. Because I made it for you to tell you the good things about you, how important you were and still are. I remember the smallest things about you but this page is less, it was just to remind you, rest of the story I will tell you on your birthday ‚ù§Ô∏èüòä";
